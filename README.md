# S-frukt-final-product
updated S-frukt application
use pip_installs for all the necessary modules
Updates:Small storage is connected with the main storage and has delete all,delete and edit options
note:All of these 3 functions when applied take directly from the main storage,
for example if you edit small storages you will either add from the main storage or subtract from it ,
delete option and delete all basically deletes small storage ,but when it does all of the quantitys they had go to the main storage.
